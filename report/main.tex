\begin{abstract}
In this report, change in mental distress over time is investigated in a group of participants that received mental health intervention and another control group that did not receive any treatment. The specific problems investigated are whether the participants' mental distresses decrease over time and whether the mental health intervention is effective in reducing the level of mental distress. Due to the longitudinal nature of the study, both the linear mixed effect models and the generalized estimating equation models are used to answer the two posed questions. It is found that while the participants' mental distresses in each of the two groups decrease significantly over time, mental health interventions do not seem to have a significant effect in reducing the level of mental distress.
